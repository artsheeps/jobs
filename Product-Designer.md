# Product Designer (m/w)

### About SumUp
We are the leading mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) company in Europe. We started out 5 years ago, building our payment service from scratch and in the process, changing the card acceptance industry forever. We created a unique device which alongside a smartphone, allows small merchants to accept card payments anywhere. Whether our merchants are brewing coffee or fixing cars, we ensured our products were something anyone could understand, so our merchants can get back to what they do best. From our paperless onboarding to taking the first payment, we make it easy.

Today, hundreds of thousands of small businesses in 30 countries around the world rely on SumUp to get paid. In addition to our original hardware, mobile and web apps we have gone on to develop a suite of APIs and SDKs to integrate SumUp payment into other apps and services.

### The Design Team

Joining the Design team will be interesting for you if youâ€™re excited by the potential to work with many different platforms/mediums with a desire and hunger to constantly improve and innovate in these spaces.

We have physical hardware (made in Berlin), localized websites, mobile apps on iOS and Android, third-party integrations and a merchant-facing web app. The Team is located in Berlin, Sofia and Sao Paolo, covering everything from User Experience and Interaction Design to Brand and Communication Design.

Help us bring card acceptance to the masses!

## What we're looking for

To us, Product Designer means you are comfortable with designing interfaces from both UX and UI perspective. As part of the design team you will be in charge of turning new features for our mobile and web applications from concept into reality and continuously improve the interface. You'll shape some of the core experiences of our merchants: from their first impression on our website, to the web-based features that make them loyal to our platform.

### You'll fit in perfectly to our team if:

* You not only know how to make things beautiful but also know how to speak the language of the user.
* You're passionate about the complete design process, from the technical architecture to the final interface.
* You think about the entire experience of users rather than a single screen in isolation.
* You care about delivering a consistent experience and visual language across all platforms.
* You're not only interested in input from developers, marketers and users, but you're able to ask the right questions, give feedback and critique your own solutions.
* By validating your assumptions with proper user research and usability testing, you make sure you're addressing the right problems the right way.
* You like working on a product from start to finish, and iterate until an excellent and solid feature can be shipped.
* You have a strong portfolio that demonstrates a well-structured, iterative design process for turning an idea into a creative and unique design.

### Requirements
* You have 5+ years experience as a UX & UI Designer
* You know the common design tools and services (we mainly use Sketch)
* Your excellent communication and presentation skills will help you collaborate with team members from a wide range of countries and cultures
* You have experience in working in an agile environment and the ability to adapt quickly to changing product priorities
* Knowledge of frontend technologies (e.g., CSS, HTML, JS), experience with prototyping tools or motion design is a plus
* You are comfortable in English. German is a bonus.

## Benefits
* Flat hierarchies and the opportunity to have an impact, irrespective of your job description.
* Convenient location in the heart of Mitte at U-Bahn Oranienburger Tor.
* All the startup swag you expect: kicker table, table tennis, beer in the fridge, and more!
* Our office has a strong sense of community; we get together regularly for brunches, cocktail nights, soccer, and yoga.
* Our team comes from 24 different countries creating a fun, international environment.

We'd be happy to receive your application including your resume, cover letter and portfolio that demonstrates your experience.
