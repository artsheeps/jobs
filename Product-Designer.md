# Product Designer (m/w)


### About us
We are the leading mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) company in Europe. Our company vision is to become the first ever global card acceptance brand. Today tens of thousands of merchants accept card payments with SumUp in 15 countries including Germany, the UK and Brazil.

Working as Designer for SumUp could be interesting for you because we cover many different platforms that we constantly try to improve: We have physical hardware (made right here in Berlin), Marketing Websites, mobile apps on iOS and Android, third-party integrations and a merchant-facing web app.

Help us bring card acceptance to the masses!

### Why work for us?
We do things differently. We are innovative, intuitive and inclusive.
We prove that it’s possible to blend people & technology, building our own devices with a one of a kind solution while keeping a close relationship towards our team and customers. We believe in open and transparent communication. We believe happiness shapes success.

## What we're looking for
To us, Product Designer means you are confortable with designing interfaces from UX and UI perspective. As part of the design team you will be in charge of turning new features for our mobile and web applications from concept into reality and continuosly improve the interface. You'll shape some of the core experiences of our merchants: from their first impression on our website, to the web-based features that make them loyal to our platform.

### Job Description
* Understand our users and how they use our products. Team up with product owners, the operations team, and other stakeholders to turn specs into meaningful, usable solutions.
* Conduct a well-structured, iterative design process, including low-fidelity prototyping, interactive mockups, and finally provide fine-tuning for the interaction when the design makes it to its final medium. Take the lead in validating your assumptions with proper user research and usability testing, to make sure we’re addressing the right problems the right way.
* Help us to constantly refine and enhance our core user experiences, such as onboarding, the sales history, and merchant self-services.
* Take charge in maintaining and applying a beautiful and usable design language to all the different avenues where users interact with our business, with special focus in our merchant-facing Dashboard, as well as native iOS and Android apps.
* Be able to code your own designs, using semantic HTML5 and any CSS pre-processor – we use SCSS packed with Bourbon mixins, but we’re always open for new fancy things.
* Embrace UI design for handheld devices. We’re iteratively designing screens for our iOS and Android apps (we’re currently doing it for the Sales History in Android, following Material Design principles), so you’ll ensure harmony and consistency across all platforms.
* Team up with our marketing team who handles websites, landing pages and support centers, to make sure all our customer-facing design is consistent across everything we do at SumUp.

### Requirements
* You have 3+ years experience as a UX & UI Designer
* You know the common design tools and services (we mainly use Sketch)
* Your excellent communication skills will help you collaborate with team members from a wide range of countries and cultures
* You have experience in working in an agile environment and the ability to adapt quickly to changing product priorities
* Knowledge of frontend technologies (e.g., CSS, HTML, JS), experience with prototyping tools or motion design is a plus
* You are comfortable in English. German is a bonus.

## Benefits
* Flat hierarchies and the opportunity to have an impact, irrespective of your job description.
* Convenient location in the heart of Mitte at U-Bahn Oranienburger Tor.
* All the startup swag you expect: kicker table, table tennis, beer in the fridge, and more!
* Our office has a strong sense of community; we get together regularly for brunches, cocktail nights, soccer, and yoga.
* Our team comes from 24 different countries creating a fun, international environment.
